# Shopping Cart Checkout technical challenge

## Task

Time: 1-2 hours.

Implement a checkout that scans items in and calculates total prices correctly for any combination of the products and offers below.

In our quest to stay in touch with what's going on in the commercial world we've decided to open a supermarket - we sell only three products:

Product code    Name            Price
FR1             Fruit tea       £3.11
SR1             Strawberries    £5.00
CF1             Coffee          £11.23

- Our CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers. She wants us to add a rule to apply this rule to fruit tea.
- The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to £4.50 each.
- Our checkout can scan items in any order.
- The CEO and COO change their minds often, so ideally this should be a flexible solution (if you have time). For example, we might want to apply the offers to different products, or add products to our range, as the supermarket grows.
